Subject: pwm: img: fix pwm clock lookup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

22e8e19 has introduced a regression in the imgchip->pwm_clk lookup, whereas
the clock name has also been renamed to "imgchip". This causes the driver
failing to load:

[    0.546905] img-pwm 18101300.pwm: failed to get imgchip clock
[    0.553418] img-pwm: probe of 18101300.pwm failed with error -2

Fix this lookup by reverting the clock name back to "pwm".
