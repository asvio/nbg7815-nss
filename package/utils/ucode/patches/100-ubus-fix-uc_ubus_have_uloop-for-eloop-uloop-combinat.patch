Subject: [PATCH] ubus: fix uc_ubus_have_uloop for eloop+uloop combination

When uloop has been integrated with eloop (in hostapd/wpa_supplicant),
uloop_cancelling will return false, since uloop_run is not being called.
This leads to ubus.defer() calling uloop_run in a context where it can
prevent the other event loop from running.

Fix this by detecting event loop integration via uloop_fd_set_cb being set
